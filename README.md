# Diversity-Challenge
Python code that was used for the Diversity Challenge event at the Royal Institution see: https://www.rigb.org/whats-on/events-2019/september/public-diversity-challenge-2019

This was made for the Raspberry Pi B+ with Raspbian installed.

The main guts of the code can be easily transported/used for your gameshow projects.
